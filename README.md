# MyRANDWork

I am creating this folder to showcase some of the programming work (basically all in R) which I have been able to do in my time 
as a graduate student and assistant policy researcher at RAND Corporation. My general area of expertise is in the analysis of 
labor markets with specific interests in skills mismatches, youth unemployment, returns to education. 
However, since coming to RAND my background has lended itself better to partaking in larger modelling projects which has seen me
transition from programming in C++ and Matlab (pre-RAND) to working almost exclusively with R. Therefore, a lot of my project work 
sees me writing functions for packages in microsimulation modelling. The code in this repository contains functions from the following
projects: 

- A microsimulation of the US child welfare system
- Using data mining algorithms to assist SACOG in meeting GHG emission targets for 2036
- A microsimulation of the Demand and Supply of Alzeihmer's Care in 2050
- The Colorectal Cancer Simulated Population Model for Incidence and Natural history (CRC-SPIN)
- Using data mining algorithms to decipher strategies for protecting 4 endangered species living along the LA River Basin
- The Comparative Assessments of Reforms Efforts (COMPARE) Microsimulation
- My Dissertation: Is an extra year of schooling worth it? A Microsimulation Approach to evaluate poverty reduction as well 
  as labor force planning policies in Nigeria
